=============================

This is a simple app that calculates and plots the trajectory of a projectile in a frictionless environment.

The server.R and ui.R are stored in a directory called "projectile".

To start the application, change the working directory to the directory containing "projectle". Then simply sun

library(shiny)
runApp("projectile")

To use the appplication, simply change the input boxes and slider to see how the trajectory is affected.
