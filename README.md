=============================

This is a simple app that calculates and plots the trajectory of a projectile in a frictionless environment.

The server.R and ui.R are stored in a directory called "projectile".

To start the application, change the working directory to the directory containing "projectle". Then simply sun

library(shiny);
runApp("projectile")

To use the appplication, simply change the input boxes and slider to see how the trajectory is affected.
